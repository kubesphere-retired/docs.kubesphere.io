Volumes, generally represents persistent volume claim (PVC) in KubeSphere, has the capability of a single disk for workloads and is a resource object that persists workloads data.

In the all-in-one deployment mode, you can use the local volume to persist data without preparing an independent storage server, but this type of volume is just for testing since it doesn't support dynamic allocation. If you would like to experience the dynamic provisioning recommended by KubeSphere, it has integrated [QingCloud-CSI](https://github.com/yunify/qingcloud-csi/blob/master/README_zh.md) or [QingStor NeonSAN](https://docs.qingcloud.com/product/storage/volume/super_high_performance_shared_volume/) plugin, support [QingCloud Block Storage](https://www.qingcloud.com/products/volume/) or [QingStor NeonSAN](https://www.qingcloud.com/products/qingstor-neonsan/) as the platform storage service, eliminating manually prepare and maintain storage servers.

In addition, Installer has integrated [NFS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs), [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/), [CephRBD](https://ceph.com/) clients, which needs to be configured in `conf/vars.yml`, but you need to prepare and install the corresponding storage server. 

The volume life cycle includes following 4 stages, we are going to demonstrate the operation of a volume's complete life cycle.

- [Create a volume](../pvc/#create-a-volume)
- [Mount a volume](../pvc/#mount-the-volume)
- [Unmount a volume](../pvc/#unmount-the-volume)
- [Delete a volume](#delete-the-volume)

## Create a Volume

Sign in with project-regular, enter into one project (e.g. demo-namespace), then select **Volumes**.

![Create a volume](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190313225514.png)

### Step 1: Fill in the Basic Information

1.1. Click **Create Volume** button, then fill in the basic information in the pop-up window. There are two ways to create a CronJob, i.e. **fill in the creation table** and **edit mode**. The following mainly introduces each step within creation table. 

If you prefer edit mode, you can click on the **edit mode**, it supports the yaml and json formats. Edit mode makes it easy for users who are used to command operations.

![edit mode](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190313225936.png)

1.2. On the basic information page, enter the name of the volume, you can also fill in the description as required.

- Name: A concise and clear name for this volume, which is convenient for users to browse and search.
- Alias: Helps you better distinguish resources and supports Chinese names.
- Description: A brief introduction to this volume.

Click **Next** when you're done.

### Step 2: Volume Settings

Select the storage class (e.g. csi-qingcloud) and volume capacity as needed. The volume capacity and access mode must match the storage server capabilities. See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes).

Each PV gets its own set of access modes describing that specific PV’s capabilities. The access modes are:

ReadWriteOnce – the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
ReadOnlyMany – the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
ReadWriteMany – the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

> Note: Local volume and block storage volume only support ReadWriteOnce.

Click **Next** when you're done.  

### Step 3: Label Settings

Set labels for this volume to identify, organize, and locate resource objects. Only the volumes whose labels match the selector can be bound to the claim. 

![Label Settings](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190314150454.png)

### Step 4: Verify the Volume

Click on the **Create** button to complete creation. The newly created volume `pvc-demo` status shows “Pending” for several seconds, and it can be mounted to the workload until its status changes to “Bound”.

> Note: If you install in **all-in-one** mode (storage class is Local by default), after the volume is created, the volume status will always show "pending" before this volume is mounted to the workload. The status will change to "Bound" until it's mounted to the workload. Actually, this is normal because of Local volume's [delay volume binding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#local), and it does not support dynamic provisioning.

## Mount the Volume

You can mount this volume to a workload. Thus you need to create such a workload to mount this volumeRefer to the following steps to create a Wordpress and mount this volume as an example.

### Step 1: Basic Information

1.1. Select an existing project (e.g. demo-namespace) and choose **Workload → Deployments**, then click on the **Create Deployment** button.

![Create a deployment](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190314155621.png)

1.2. Fill in the basic information in the pop-up window.

![Fill in the Basic Information](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190314155729.png)

### Step 2: Pod Template

Click **Add Container**, fill in the image with `wordpress:4.8-apache`, take Wordpress as an example, then click **Save** and **Next** when you're done.

![Pod template](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190314165752.png)

### Step 3: Volume Settings

1. Click **Add Existing Volume**.

![Volume Settings](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190315094834.png)

2. Select the `pvc-demo` we created earlier.

![Volume Settings](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190315095004.png)

3. Choose `Read and Write` mode, and fill in the path with `/var/www/html`.

![Volume Settings](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190315151253.png)

Click **save** and choose **Next**.

### Step 4: Label Settings

Leave the default label as `app : wordpress`, there is no need to point the node selector, finally click **Create**.

### Verify the Mount Status

After the deployment is complete, you can see that the `pvc-demo` volume shows **running** in the list.

## Unmount the Volume

Note that if you need to delete a volume, make sure the volume mount status is `Not Mounted`. If the volume is mounted to the workload, you need to unmount (delete) the volume in the workload or delete the workload directly at first. The volume mounted on the workload Wordpress is deleted (uninstalled) as follows.

![Unmount the Volume](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190315155704.png)

## Delete the Volume

Click **Volumes** on the left menu in current project. As shown below, the mount status of **pvc-demo** showing **Not Mounted** thus it can be deleted. Check the volume **pvc-demo** and click **Delete**.
