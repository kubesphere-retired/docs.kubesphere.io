You can invite new members to join and assist with your project. Before you invite new members, make sure that the user and member roles have been created in advance, also make sure that the member has been invited to the same workspace before they can be invited to the project, see [Account Management](../../platform-management/account-management) and [Member Roles](../project-roles) for details.

## Invite a New Member

Sign in with project-admin, enter into one project (e.g. demo-namespace), then select **Project Settings â†’ Project Members**.

Click **Invite member**, select the user click **+** in the pop-up window, and invite the member to join the project. For example, in the screenshot below, the ws-admin will be invited to the current project and is granted the `workload-operator` that created in [Member Role](../project-roles).
