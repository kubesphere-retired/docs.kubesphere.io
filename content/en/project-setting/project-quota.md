The basic information supports managing the following resources information of the current project: 

- Basic information
- Resource quota 
- Resource requests and limits

The quota information management is designed for the project level and is used to limit the resource usage within the project. The resource request and limits are designed for the container level. When you create a workload, by default the container's CPU and memory requests and limits will use the value which is set in the default request and limits.
