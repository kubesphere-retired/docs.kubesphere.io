As we demonstrated in [Managing Canary Release of Microservice App based on Istio](../bookinfo-canary), you can use KubeSphere to implement grayscale release in your project based on Istio. However, many users are not using Istio. Most projects from these users are pretty simple so that we need to provide a light-weight solution for this case.

[Ingress-Nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/nginx-0.21.0) brings a new feature with "Canary", which could be used as a load balancer for gateway. The canary annotation enables the Ingress spec to act as an alternative service for requests to route to depending on the applied rules, and control the traffic splits. KubeSphere built-in gateway of each project supports the "Canary" feature of [Ingress-Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#canary).

We have elaborated on the scenarios of grayscale in the Istio bookinfo guide. In this document we are going to demonstrate how to use KubeSphere route and gateway, namely, Ingress and Ingress-Controller, to implement grayscale release.

> Note: The demo YAML files has been uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/tutorial).

## Ingress-Nginx Annotation

Based on [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/#nginx-ingress-controller), KubeSphere implements the gateway in each project, namely, Kubernetes namespace, serving as the traffic entry and a reverse proxy of each project. Nginx annotations support the following rules after `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"` is set. Please refer to [Nginx Annotations](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#canary) for further explanation.

- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header`
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header-value`
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight`
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-cookie`

> Note: Canary rules are evaluated in order of precedence. Precedence is as follows:
> `canary-by-header - > canary-by-cookie - > canary-weight`.

The four annotation rules above can be generally divided into the following two categories:

- The canary rules based on the weight

- The canary rules based on the user request

## Prerequisites

- You need to complete all steps in [Getting Started with Multi-tenant Management](../admin-quick-start.md).

## Hands-on Lab

### Step 1: Create Project and Application

1.1. Use `project-admin` account to log in KubeSphere, create a project `ingress-demo` under the workspace `demo-workspace`. Go to **Project Settings → Advanced Settings**, click **Set Gateway**, and click **Save** to open the gateway in this project. Note it defaults to **NodePort**.

![Set Gateway](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200229123307.png)

1.2. We are going to use command line to create the resources provided by the following yaml files. Log in KubeSphere with `admin` account, open **Web kubectl** from the **Toolbox** at the bottom-right corner of console, then use the following command to create production resources `Deployment` and `Service`:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f production.yaml -n ingress-demo
deployment.extensions/production created
service/production created
```

The file is as follows:

#### production.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    app: production
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: production
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: production
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: production
        image: mirrorgooglecontainers/echoserver:1.10
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
          - name: NODE_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: spec.nodeName
          - name: POD_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
          - name: POD_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          - name: POD_IP
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.podIP

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    app: production
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  selector:
    app: production
```

1.3. Now create a `production` Ingress.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f production.ingress -n ingress-demo
ingress.extensions/production created
```

The file is as follows:

#### production.ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: production
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
  - host: kubesphere.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: production
          servicePort: 80
```

### Step 2: Access the Production Application

You can verify each resource by navigating to the corresponding lists from the console.

**Deployment**
![Deployment](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200229122819.png)

**Service**
![Service](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200229122918.png)

**Route (Ingress)**
![Ingress](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200229122939.png)

Use the command to access the application of production.

> Note: `192.168.0.88` is the gateway address of each project and `30205` is the NodePort. You need yo replace with the actual values from the Route details page.

```bash
$ curl --resolve kubesphere.io:30205:192.168.0.88 kubesphere.io:30205

Hostname: production-6b4bb8d58d-7r889

Pod Information:
  node name:	ks-allinone
	pod name:	production-6b4bb8d58d-7r889
	pod namespace:	ingress-demo
	pod IP:	10.233.87.165

Server values:
	server_version=nginx: 1.12.2 - lua: 10010

Request Information:
	client_address=10.233.87.225
	method=GET
	real path=/
	query=
	request_version=1.1
	request_scheme=http
	request_uri=http://kubesphere.io:8080/

Request Headers:
	accept=*/*
	host=kubesphere.io:30205
	user-agent=curl/7.29.0
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
	x-forwarded-for=192.168.0.88
	x-forwarded-host=kubesphere.io:30205
	x-forwarded-port=80
	x-forwarded-proto=http
	x-original-uri=/
	x-real-ip=192.168.0.88
	x-request-id=9596df96e994ea05bece2ebbe689a2cc
	x-scheme=http

Request Body:
	-no body in request-
```

### Step 3: Create Canary Version of the Application

Same as above, refer to the yaml files that we used in **production** to create an application of **canary** version, including `Deployment` and `Service`, you just need to replace the occurrences of `production` with `canary` in those yaml files.

### Step 4: Ingress-Nginx Annotation Rules

#### Set Canary Release based on Weight

A typical scenario of the rule is based on weight, that is, `blue-green` deployment. You can set the weight from `0` to `100` to implement that kind of application release. At any time, only one of the environments is production. For this example, currently green is production and blue is canary. Initially, the weight of canary is set to `0` which means no traffic is forwarded to this release. You can introduce a small portion of traffic to blue version step by step, test and verify it. If everything is OK then you can shift all requests from green to blue by set the weight of blue to `100` which makes blue the production release. In a word, with such canary releasing process, the application is upgraded smoothly.

4.1. Now create a `canary` Ingress. The following file uses `canary-weight` annotation to introduce `30%` of all traffic to the canary version.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f weighted-canary.ingress -n ingress-demo
ingress.extensions/canary created
```

The yaml file is as follows.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: canary
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "30"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: kubesphere.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: canary
          servicePort: 80
```

4.2. Verify the Weighted Canary Release

> Note: Although we set `30%` of traffic to the canary, the traffic ratio may fluctuate to a small extent.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -s --resolve kubesphere.io:30205:192.168.0.88 kubesphere.io:30205 | grep "Hostname"; done
```

![Canary Release based on Weight](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200205162603.png)

#### Set Canary Release based on Request Header

4.3. Go to **Application Workloads → Routes**, click into the detailed page of route `canary`, then go to **More → Edit Annotations**. Follow the screenshot below, add a row of annotation with `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header: canary` to the Ingress of canary release created above. The header to use for notifying the Ingress to route the request to the service specified in the canary Ingress.

> Note: Canary rules are evaluated in order of precedence. Precedence is as follows:
> `canary-by-header - > canary-by-cookie - > canary-weight`. Thus the the old annotation `canary-weight` will be ignored.

![Edit annotation](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200304220417.png)

4.4. Add different header in the request, and access the application domain name. More specifically,

- When the request header is set to `always`, it will be routed to the canary.
- When the header is set to `never`, it will never be routed to the canary.

> Note: For any other value, the header will be ignored and the request compared against the other canary rules by precedence.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -s -H "canary: never" --resolve kubesphere.io:30205:192.168.0.88 kubesphere.io:30205 | grep "Hostname"; done
```

![Request Header](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200205231401.png)

We set the `canary: other-value` in the header, the Ingress with canary value `30%` to take precedence over others.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -s -H "canary: other-value" --resolve kubesphere.io:30205:192.168.0.88 kubesphere.io:30205 | grep "Hostname"; done
```

![Request Header](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200205231455.png)

4.5. Now we can add a new row of annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header-value: user-value` which is for notifying the Ingress to route the request to the service specified in the canary Ingress.

![Canary by Header Value](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200305093713.png)

4.6. Access the domain name as follows, when the request header is set to this value, it will be routed to the canary version. For any other header value, the header will be ignored and the request is compared against the other canary rules by precedence.

> Note: It allows users to customize the value of Request Header.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -s -H "canary: user-value" --resolve kubesphere.io:30205:192.168.0.88 kubesphere.io:30205 | grep "Hostname"; done
```

![Request Header](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200205231634.png)

#### Based on Cookie

4.7. Similar to Request Header, the cookie to use for notifying the Ingress to route the request to the service specified in the canary Ingress. When the cookie value is set to always, it will be routed to the canary version, otherwise, it will never be routed to the canary version. For any other value, the cookie will be ignored and the request is compared against the other canary rules by precedence. For example, if we only allow the users from London to access the canary version, we can set the annotation with `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-cookie: "users_from_London"`. At this point, the system will check the user request, if the requests are from London, then set the value of cookie `users_from_London` to `always`, in order to ensure only the users from London access the canary version.

## Conclusion

Grayscale release can ensure overall system stability. You can find problems and make adjustments at the initial gray scale to minimize the degree of impact. We have demonstrated four annotation rules of Ingress-Nginx. It is convenient and light-weight for users who want to implement grayscale release without Istio.
