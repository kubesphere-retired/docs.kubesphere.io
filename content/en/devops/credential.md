A DevOps project user can configure credentials for Jenkins Pipeline. Once a user (e.g. Owner and Maintainer) adds/configures these credentials in DevOps project, the credentials can be used by DevOps projects to interact with these third-party applications.

Currently, it can store the following 4 types of credentials in DevOps project:

- Account credentials: Username and password - which could be handled as separate components or as a colon separated string in the format username:password, such as GitHub, GitLab, Docker Hub, etc.
- SSH: Username with private key - an SSH public/private key pair.
- Secret text: Secret content in a file.
- kubeconfig: It's used to configure cross-cluster authentication, the page will automatically generate the contents of the kubeconfig file of the current Kubernetes cluster.

## Create Credential

Sign in with `project-regular`, choose **Credentials** and click **Create Credential**.

### Create Credential for DockerHub

1. Click **Create**, fill in the basic information in the pop-up window.

- Credential ID: it will be used in pipeline, name it **dockerhub-id**
- Type: Choose `Account Credentials`
- Username: Your DockerHub account
- Token/password: Your DockerHub password
- Description: A brief introduction to this credential.


Click **OK** when you've done.

### Create Credential for GitHub

Similarly, we create a GitHub Credential and name it `github-id`, choose **Account Credentials**, others are the same with above.

> Note: If there is any special characters includes `@` `$`, it may cause unrecognizable error. You need to encode your account or password through third-party website, e.g. [urlencoder](https://www.urlencoder.org/), please convert it and paste to KubeSphere console.

### Create KubeConfig Credential

The same as above, create a Credential, name it `demo-kubeconfig`, choose **kubeconfig**, click **Create** to complete creation.

> Note: A file that is used to configure access to clusters is called a kubeconfig file. Thus we create the kubeconfig credential to access the current Kubernetes cluster, which will be used in pipeline. You don't need to change the file since KubeSphere will automatically load the kubeconfig of the current Kubernetes cluster. On the contrary, you may need to change kubeconfig in KubeSphere when access other cluster.

At this point, you can return to the quick start guides to complete the rest steps.

## Using the Credential

1. When you creating a Pipeline, click on **Code Repository**.
