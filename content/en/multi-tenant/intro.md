The core of multi-tenancy is to allocate the authority relationship between different users and resources. For the container management platform, the main resources are computing resources, storage resources and network resources, which are also the key object resources of KubeSphere multi-tenany.

In the KubeSphere multi-tenancy system, resources are divided into three levels: 

- Cluster
- Workspace
- Project and DevOps project

Resources at different levels can be flexibly customized to divide users' permission scope, which is used to achieve resource isolation between different users.

## Authority Management Model

Common permission management models include ACL, DAC, MAC, RBAC and ABAC. In KubeSphere, we make use of the RBAC authority management model to control users' authority. Users don't need to directly associate with resources, but carry out authority control through role definition.

## Resource Hierarchy

**Cluster**

Clustering refers to the current Kubernetes cluster, which provides computing, storage, and network resources for tenants. workspaces can be created under a cluster.

**Workspaces**

Under a cluster, you can create workspaces to manage different projects in groups. Projects and DevOps projects can be created in workspaces.

**Projects and DevOps projects**

Projects, DevOps projects are the minimum level of version permission management, consuming the resources of the cluster to deploy and build applications.


## Multi-level Permission Control

**Cluster permission control**

Cluster roles define user control over cluster resources, such as nodes, monitoring, accounts, and so on.

**Workspaces permission control**

The workspaces role defines the user's control authority over projects and projects in the workspaces and the management authority of workspaces members.

**Project and project permission control**

Creators of projects and projects can share their projects with other users by inviting members, giving different members different roles and differentiating permissions.

## Details

In familiar and understand the resource hierarchy, permissions management way, to taichung every level administrators and ordinary users, understand the meaning of each grade of concrete members and roles, how to better management platform, the role of members and is the key links of actual use, please continue to refer to the [role authorization overview](../role-overview).
