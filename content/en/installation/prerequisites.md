Not only can KubeSphere be installed on virtual machines and bare metal with provisioned Kubernetes, but also supports installing on cloud-hosted and on-premises existing Kubernetes clusters as long as your Kubernetes cluster meets the prerequisites below.

- `Kubernetes version`:  `1.15.x, 1.16.x, 1.17.x, 1.18.x`;
- CPU > 1 Core; Memory > 2 G;
- A default Storage Class in your Kubernetes cluster is configured; use `kubectl get sc` to verify it.
- The CSR signing feature is activated in kube-apiserver when it is started with the `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and `--cluster-signing-key-file` parameters. See [RKE installation issue](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/1925#issuecomment-591698309).

## Pre-checks

1. Make sure your Kubernetes version is compatible by running `kubectl version` in your cluster node. The output may look as below:

```bash
$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.1", GitCommit:"4485c6f18cee9a5d3c3b4e523bd27972b1b53892", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-07-18T09:09:21Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.1", GitCommit:"4485c6f18cee9a5d3c3b4e523bd27972b1b53892", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-07-18T09:09:21Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

> Note: Pay attention to the `Server Version` line. If `GitVersion` shows an older one, you need to upgrade Kubernetes first. Please refer to [Upgrading kubeadm clusters from v1.14 to v1.15](https://v1-15.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade-1-15/).

2. Check if the available resources in your cluster meet the minimum requirements.

```bash
$ free -g
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:              16          4          10           0           3           2
Swap:             0           0           0
```

3. Check if there is a default Storage Class in your cluster. An existing Storage Class is a prerequisite for KubeSphere installation.

```bash
$ kubectl get sc
NAME                      PROVISIONER               AGE
glusterfs (default)       kubernetes.io/glusterfs   3d4h
```

If your Kubernetes cluster environment meets all the requirements above, then you are ready to deploy KubeSphere on your existing Kubernetes cluster.
