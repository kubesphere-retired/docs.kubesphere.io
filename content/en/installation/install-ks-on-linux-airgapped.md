---

The air-gapped installation is almost the same as the online installation except it creates a local registry to host the Docker images. We will demonstrate how to install KubeSphere and Kubernetes on air-gapped environment.

> Note: The dependencies in different operating systems may cause upexpected problems. If you encounter any installation problems on air-gapped environment, please describe your OS information and error logs on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues).

## Prerequisites

- If your machine is behind a firewall, you need to open the ports by following the document [Ports Requirements](../port-firewall) for more information.
> - Installer will use `/var/lib/docker` as the default directory where all Docker related files, including the images, are stored. We recommend you to add additional storage to a disk with at least 100G mounted at `/var/lib/docker` and `/mnt/registry` respectively, use the [fdisk](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/fdisk.htm) command for reference.
- Installer uses [Local volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) based on [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) to provide storage service with dynamic provisioning. It is convenient for testing and development. For production, please [configure supported persistent storage service](../storage-configuration) and prepare [high availability configuration](../master-ha) before installation.
- Since the air-gapped machines cannot connect to apt or yum source, please use clean Linux machine to avoid this problem.

## Step 1: Prepare Linux Hosts

The following describes the requirements of hardware and operating system. To get started with multi-node installation, you need to prepare at least `three` hosts according to the following requirements.

- Supported OSes: CentOS 7.4 ~ 7.7 (64-bit), Ubuntu 16.04.5/16.04.6/18.04.1/18.04.2/18.04.3 LTS (64-bit)
- Time synchronization is required across all nodes, otherwise the installation may not succeed;
- For `Ubuntu 16.04` OS, it is recommended to select `16.04.5`;
- If you are using `Ubuntu 18.04`, you need to use the user `root`.
- Ensure your disk of each node is at least 100G.
- CPU and memory in total of all machines: 2 cores and 4 GB for minimal installation; 8 cores and 16 GB for complete installation.


The following section describes an example to introduce multi-node installation. This example shows three hosts installation by taking the `master` serving as the taskbox to execute the installation. The following cluster consists of one Master and two Nodes.

> Note: KubeSphere supports the high-availability configuration of the Masters and Etcd nodes. Please refer to [Creating High Availability KubeSphere Cluster](../master-ha) for guide.

| Host IP | Host Name | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
|192.168.0.1|master|master, etcd|
|192.168.0.2|node1|node|
|192.168.0.3|node2|node|

### Cluster Architecture

#### Single Master, Single Etcd, Two Nodes

![Architecture](/cluster-architecture.svg)

## Step 2: Download Installer Package

Download `KubeSphere 2.1.1` to your taskbox machine, then unpack it and go to the folder `conf`.

```bash
curl -L https://kubesphere.io/download/offline/latest > kubesphere-all-offline-v2.1.1.tar.gz \
&& tar -zxf kubesphere-all-offline-v2.1.1.tar.gz && cd kubesphere-all-offline-v2.1.1/conf
```

## Step 3: Configure Host Template

> This step is only for multi-node installation, you can skip this step if you choose all-in-one installation.

Please refer to the following sample to configure all hosts in `hosts.ini`. It is recommended to install KubeSphere using root user. The following is an example configuration for `CentOS 7.5` using root user. Note do not manually wrap any line in the file.

> Note:
>
> - If you use non-root user with sudo access to install KubeSphere, you need to refer to the example block that is commented out in `conf/hosts.ini`.
> - If the `root` user of that taskbox machine cannot establish SSH connection with the rest of machines, you need to refer to the `non-root` user example at the top of the `conf/hosts.ini`, but it is recommended to switch `root` user when executing `install.sh`.
> - master, node1 and node2 are the host names of each node and all host names should be in lowercase.

### hosts.ini

```ini
[all]
master ansible_connection=local  ip=192.168.0.1
node1  ansible_host=192.168.0.2  ip=192.168.0.2  ansible_ssh_pass=PASSWORD
node2  ansible_host=192.168.0.3  ip=192.168.0.3  ansible_ssh_pass=PASSWORD

[local-registry]
master

[kube-master]
master

[kube-node]
node1
node2

[etcd]
master

[k8s-cluster:children]
kube-node
kube-master
```

> Note:
>
> - You need to replace each node information such as IP, password with real values in the group `[all]`. The master node is the taskbox so you do not need to add password field here.
> - Installer will use a node as the local registry for docker images, defaults to "master" in the group `[local-registry]`.
> - The "master" node also takes the role of master and etcd, so "master" is filled under the group`[kube-master]` and the group `[etcd]` respectively.
> - "node1" and "node2" both serve the role of `Node`, so they are filled under the group `[kube-node]`.
>
> Parameters Specification:
>
> - `ansible_connection`: Connection type to the host, "local" in the example above means local connection.
> - `ansible_host`: The name of the host to be connected.
> - `ip`: The ip of the host to be connected.
> - `ansible_user`: The default ssh user name to use.
> - `ansible_become_pass`: Allows you to set the privilege escalation password.
> - `ansible_ssh_pass`: The password of the host to be connected using root.

## Step 4: Enable All Components

> This is step is complete installation. You can skip this step if you choose a minimal installation.

Edit `conf/common.yaml`, reference the following changes with values being `true` which are `false` by default.

```yaml
# LOGGING CONFIGURATION

```

## Step 5: Install KubeSphere to Linux Machines

> Note:
>
> - Generally, you can install KubeSphere without any modification, it will start with minimal installation by default.
> - If you want to enable pluggable feature components installation, modify common.yaml and refer to [Enable Pluggable Components Installation](../pluggable-components) for instructions.
> - Installer uses [Local volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) based on [openEBS](https://openebs.io/) to provide storage service with dynamic provisioning. For production environment, please [configure supported persistent storage service](../storage-configuration) before installation.
> - Since the default subnet for Cluster IPs is 10.233.0.0/18, and the default subnet for Pod IPs is 10.233.64.0/18, the node IPs must not use the two IP range. You can modify the default subnets `kube_service_addresses` or `kube_pods_subnet` in the file `conf/common.yaml` to avoid conflicts.

**1.** Enter `scripts` folder, and execute `install.sh` using `root` user:

```bash
cd ../cripts
./install.sh
```

**2.** Type `2` to select multi-node mode to start the installation. The installer will ask you if you have set up persistent storage service or not. Just type `yes` since we are going to use local volume.

```bash

## Enable Pluggable Components

If you already have set up minimal installation, you still can edit the ConfigMap of ks-installer using the following command. Please make sure there is enough resource in your machines, see [Pluggable Components Overview](/en/installation/pluggable-components/).

```bash
kubectl edit cm -n kubesphere-system ks-installer
```
