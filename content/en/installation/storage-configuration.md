Currently, Installer supports the following [Storage Class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/), providing persistent storage service for KubeSphere (more storage classes will be supported soon).

- NFS
- Ceph RBD
- GlusterFS
- QingCloud Block Storage
- QingStor NeonSAN
- Local Volume (for development and test only)

The versions of storage systems and corresponding CSI plugins in the table listed below have been well tested.

> Note: You are only allowed to set ONE default storage classes in the cluster. To specify a default storage class, make sure there is no default storage class already exited in the cluster.

## Storage Configuration

After preparing the storage server, you need to refer to the parameters description in the following table. Then modify the corresponding configurations in `conf/common.yaml` accordingly.

The following describes the storage configuration in `common.yaml`.

> Note: Local Volume is configured as the default storage class in `common.yaml` by default. If you are going to set other storage class as the default, disable the Local Volume and modify the configuration for other storage class.

### Local Volume (For developing or testing only)

A [Local Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) represents a mounted local storage device such as a disk, partition or directory. Local volumes can only be used as a statically created PersistentVolume. We recommend you to use Local volume in testing or development only since it is quick and easy to install KubeSphere without the struggle to set up persistent storage server. Refer to following table for the definition in `conf/common.yaml`.

| **Local volume** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| local\_volume\_provisioner\_enabled | Whether to use Local as the persistent storage, defaults to true |
| local\_volume\_provisioner\_storage\_class | Storage class name, default value：local |
| local\_volume\_is\_default\_class | Whether to set Local as the default storage class, defaults to true.|

### NFS

An NFS volume allows an existing NFS (Network File System) share to be mounted into your Pod. NFS can be configured in `conf/common.yaml`. Note you need to prepare NFS server in advance.

| **NFS** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| nfs\_client\_enable | Whether to use NFS as the persistent storage, defaults to false |
| nfs\_client\_is\_default\_class | Whether to set NFS as default storage class, defaults to false. |
| nfs\_server | The NFS server address, either IP or Hostname |
| nfs\_path | NFS shared directory, which is the file directory shared on the server, see [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs) |
|nfs\_vers3\_enabled | Specifies which version of the NFS protocol to use, defaults to false which means v4. True means v4 |
|nfs_archiveOnDelete | Archive PVC when deleting. It will automatically remove data from `oldPath` when it sets to false |

### Ceph RBD

The open source [Ceph RBD](https://ceph.com/) distributed storage system can be configured to use in `conf/common.yaml`. You need to prepare Ceph storage server in advance. Please refer to [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#ceph-rbd) for more details.

| **Ceph\_RBD** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ceph\_rbd\_enabled | Whether to use Ceph RBD as the persistent storage, defaults to false |
| ceph\_rbd\_storage\_class | Storage class name |
| ceph\_rbd\_is\_default\_class | Whether to set Ceph RBD as default storage class, defaults to false |
| ceph\_rbd\_monitors | Ceph monitors, comma delimited. This parameter is required, which depends on Ceph RBD server parameters |
| ceph\_rbd\_admin\_id | Ceph client ID that is capable of creating images in the pool. Defaults to “admin” |
| ceph\_rbd\_admin\_secret | Admin_id's secret, secret name for "adminId". This parameter is required. The provided secret must have type “kubernetes.io/rbd” |
| ceph\_rbd\_pool | Ceph RBD pool. Default is “rbd” |
| ceph\_rbd\_user\_id | Ceph client ID that is used to map the RBD image. Default is the same as adminId |
| ceph\_rbd\_user\_secret | Secret for User_id, it is required to create this secret in namespace which used rbd image |
| ceph\_rbd\_fsType | fsType that is supported by Kubernetes. Default: "ext4"|
| ceph\_rbd\_imageFormat | Ceph RBD image format, “1” or “2”. Default is “1” |
|ceph\_rbd\_imageFeatures| This parameter is optional and should only be used if you set imageFormat to “2”. Currently supported features are layering only. Default is “”, and no features are turned on|

> Note:
>
> The ceph secret, which is created in storage class, like "ceph_rbd_admin_secret" and "ceph_rbd_user_secret", is retrieved using following command in Ceph storage server.

```bash
ceph auth get-key client.admin
```

### GlusterFS

[GlusterFS](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/) is a scalable network filesystem suitable for data-intensive tasks such as cloud storage and media streaming. You need to prepare GlusterFS storage server in advance. Please refer to [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#glusterfs) for further information.

### QingCloud Block Storage

[QingCloud Block Storage](https://docs.qingcloud.com/product/Storage/volume/) is supported in KubeSphere as the persistent storage service. If you would like to experience dynamic provisioning when creating volume, we recommend you to use it as your persistent storage solution. KubeSphere integrates [QingCloud-CSI](https://github.com/yunify/qingcloud-csi/blob/master/README_zh.md), and allows you to use various block storage services of QingCloud. With simple configuration, you can quickly expand, clone PVCs and view the topology of PVCs, create/delete snapshot, as well as restore volume from snapshot.

QingCloud-CSI plugin has implemented the standard CSI. You can easily create and manage different types of volumes in KubeSphere, which are provided by QingCloud. The corresponding PVCs will created with ReadWriteOnce access mode and mounted to running Pods.

QingCloud-CSI supports create the following five types of volume in QingCloud:

- High capacity
- Standard
- SSD Enterprise
- Super high performance
- High performance
