`Multi-Node` installation enables installing KubeSphere on multiple nodes. Typically, use any one node as _taskbox_ to run the installation task. Please note `ssh` communication is required to be established between taskbox and other nodes.

- <font color=red>The following instructions are for the default installation without enabling any optional components as we have made them pluggable since v2.1.0. If you want to enable any one, please read [Enable Pluggable Components](../pluggable-components).</font>
- <font color=red>If your machines in total have >= 8 cores and >= 16G memory, we recommend you to install the full package of KubeSphere by [Enabling Optional Components](../complete-installation)</font>.
- <font color=red> The installation time depends on your network bandwidth, your computer configuration, the number of nodes, etc. </font>

## Video Demo

The video shows how to install KubeSphere on multiple virtual machines on [QingCloud](https://www.qingcloud.com). It would be same to install on any other machines.

## Prerequisites

If your machine is behind a firewall, you need to open the ports by following the document [Ports Requirements](../port-firewall) for more information.

## Step 1: Prepare Linux Hosts

The following describes the requirements of hardware and operating system. To get started with multi-node installation, you need to prepare at least `three` hosts according to the following requirements.

- Time synchronization is required across all nodes, otherwise the installation may not succeed;
- For `Ubuntu 16.04` OS, it is recommended to select `16.04.5`;
- If you are using `Ubuntu 18.04`, you need to use the user `root`;
- If the Debian system does not have the sudo command installed, you need to execute `apt update && apt install sudo` command using root before installation.

### Hardware Recommendation

- KubeSphere can be installed on any cloud platform.
- The installation speed can be accelerated by increasing network bandwidth.
- If you choose air-gapped installation, ensure your disk of each node is at least 100G.

| System | Minimum Requirements (Each node) |
| --- | --- |
| CentOS 7.5 (64 bit) | CPU：2 Core， Memory：4 G， Disk Space：40 G  |
| Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS (64 bit) | CPU：2 Core， Memory：4 G， Disk Space：40 G  |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.4 (64 bit) | CPU：2 Core， Memory：4 G， Disk Space：40 G  |
| Debian Stretch 9.5 (64 bit)| CPU：2 Core， Memory：4 G， Disk Space：40 G  |

The following section describes an example to introduce multi-node installation. This example shows three hosts installation by taking the `master` serving as the taskbox to execute the installation. The following cluster consists of one Master and two Nodes.

> Note: KubeSphere supports the high-availability configuration of the Masters and Etcd nodes. Please refer to [Creating High Availability KubeSphere Cluster](../master-ha) for guide.

| Host IP | Host Name | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
|192.168.0.1|master|master, etcd|
|192.168.0.2|node1|node|
|192.168.0.3|node2|node|

### Cluster Architecture

#### Single Master, Single Etcd, Two Nodes

## Step 2: Download Installer Package

**1.** Download `KubeSphere 2.1.1` to your taskbox machine, then unpack it and go to the folder `conf`.

```bash
curl -L https://kubesphere.io/download/stable/latest > installer.tar.gz \
&& tar -zxf installer.tar.gz && cd kubesphere-all-v2.1.1/conf
```

**2.** Please refer to the following sample to configure all hosts in `hosts.ini`. It is recommended to install KubeSphere using root user. The following is an example configuration for `CentOS 7.5` using root user. Note do not manually wrap any line in the file.

> Note:
>
> - If you use non-root user with sudo access to install KubeSphere, you need to refer to the example block that is commented out in `conf/hosts.ini`.
> - If the `root` user of that taskbox machine cannot establish SSH connection with the rest of machines, you need to refer to the `non-root` user example at the top of the `conf/hosts.ini`, but it is recommended to switch `root` user when executing `install.sh`.
> - master, node1 and node2 are the host names of each node and all host names should be in lowercase.

### hosts.ini

```ini
[all]
master ansible_connection=local  ip=192.168.0.1
node1  ansible_host=192.168.0.2  ip=192.168.0.2  ansible_ssh_pass=PASSWORD
node2  ansible_host=192.168.0.3  ip=192.168.0.3  ansible_ssh_pass=PASSWORD

[kube-master]
master

[kube-node]
node1
node2

[etcd]
master

[k8s-cluster:children]
kube-node
kube-master
```

> Note:
>
> - You need to replace each node information such as IP, password with real values in the group `[all]`. The master node is the taskbox so you do not need to add password field here.
> - The "master" node also takes the role of master and etcd, so "master" is filled under the group`[kube-master]` and the group `[etcd]` respectively.
> - "node1" and "node2" both serve the role of `Node`, so they are filled under the group `[kube-node]`.
>
> Parameters Specification:
>
> - `ansible_connection`: Connection type to the host, "local" in the example above means local connection.
> - `ansible_host`: The name of the host to be connected.
> - `ip`: The ip of the host to be connected.
> - `ansible_user`: The default ssh user name to use.
> - `ansible_become_pass`: Allows you to set the privilege escalation password.
> - `ansible_ssh_pass`: The password of the host to be connected using root.

## Step 3: Install KubeSphere to Linux Machines

> Note:
>
> - Generally, you can install KubeSphere without any modification, it will start with minimal installation by default.
> - If you want to enable pluggable feature components installation, modify common.yaml and refer to [Enable Pluggable Components Installation](../pluggable-components) for instructions.
> - Installer uses [Local volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) based on [openEBS](https://openebs.io/) to provide storage service with dynamic provisioning. For production environment, please [configure supported persistent storage service](../storage-configuration) before installation.
> - Since the default subnet for Cluster IPs is 10.233.0.0/18, and the default subnet for Pod IPs is 10.233.64.0/18, the node IPs must not use the two IP range. You can modify the default subnets `kube_service_addresses` or `kube_pods_subnet` in the file `conf/common.yaml` to avoid conflicts.

**1.** Enter `scripts` folder, and execute `install.sh` using `root` user:

```bash
cd ../cripts
./install.sh
```

**2.** Type `2` to select multi-node mode to start the installation. The installer will ask you if you have set up persistent storage service or not. Just type `yes` since we are going to use local volume.

```bash
