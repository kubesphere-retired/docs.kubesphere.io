In addition to monitoring the data from physical resource level, the cluster admin needs to know how many application resources, such as the number of projects and DevOps projects, as well as how many specific types of workloads and services has already been used in the platform. Application resource monitoring is a summary of the resource usage and trends of the application level of the platform.

## Resource Usage

Choose **Monitoring Center â†’ Application Resources** to enter the overview page of application resource monitoring, including the summary of the usage of all resources in the cluster, as shown in the following figure.

Among them, cluster resource usage and application resource usage will retain the monitoring data of the last 7 days, and support custom time range query.

### Project Usage Ranking

There can be multiple project in a workspace. The quota, resource usage, and network speed between different projects can be seen at a glance through this part of the ranking result. The five monitoring indicators mentioned in workspace above are also supported.
